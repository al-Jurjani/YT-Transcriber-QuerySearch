[0.00]  Thank you to the Roy's YouTube community.
[2.60]  We asked you all some questions,
[4.40]  or we asked you to give us some questions
[6.20]  about the current situation,
[8.10]  the conflict between Israel and Iran.
[10.80]  Today is, what is today, June 24th.
[15.16]  So for some context,
[18.28]  the US recently had an air strike in Iran
[22.20]  and they retaliated on an air base in Qatar.
[26.56]  And now there is a ceasefire
[30.12]  that has within the past 12, 24 hours.
[33.80]  So given that context,
[35.76]  Roy is going to answer some of the questions you gave us.
[38.24]  Thank you for all the questions.
[39.92]  We had over 200 responses.
[41.64]  And so these are some of the ones
[44.20]  that we boiled down to ask Roy.
[46.72]  Hello, Roy.
[47.56]  Hi, how's it going?
[49.56]  Good.
[50.56]  It's you, Jeremy.
[51.56]  It's good to see your voice.
[53.68]  Yes, it has been.
[55.04]  All right, are you ready for the first question?
[56.28]  Yeah, let's do it.
[57.84]  Okay, first question.
[58.68]  We're going to start with some historical foundations.
[60.48]  We have a couple of questions from this category.
[65.16]  How have US-Iran relations evolved
[68.60]  since the 1953 CIA backed coup
[72.52]  and how do those events still shape
[74.68]  current tensions today?
[76.80]  Okay, well, that's a foundational question.
[80.16]  So, and the British Empire is imagination.
[86.28]  Iran was supposed to end up inside the British Empire,
[89.64]  at least part of it.
[92.00]  What they realized was that they didn't really have
[94.32]  the tools to conquer Iran.
[96.20]  They didn't have the resources.
[97.44]  They were too spread out.
[99.72]  There's enough that they conquered India.
[102.04]  So they came up with an idea that they would co-conquer
[105.64]  Iran with the Russians.
[107.96]  And it ended up in Saik's Pika,
[110.52]  which was the plan to divide up the Middle East
[112.84]  between France and Great Britain.
[115.92]  And France and Great Britain made the plan.
[118.04]  They were going to include Greece and Italy and Russia,
[121.16]  but they didn't ever ask those countries for their opinion.
[124.40]  They were just being thrown in.
[127.72]  And then the Russians had the communist revolution
[130.40]  and the Soviet Union told them there was no possibility
[135.16]  to do this.
[136.64]  But that's after the Russians did actually invade Iran
[141.64]  in 1909.
[143.52]  And the British and the Russians worked together
[146.24]  to overthrow Iran's first attempt at a democracy,
[148.84]  which was created in 1906.
[152.12]  And they successfully tanked that democracy.
[154.28]  So in 1950, Iran created its second attempt at a democracy.
[159.04]  And in 1953, the United States, CIA conducted a coup d'etat
[164.28]  on overthrow Iran's second democracy.
[166.32]  So its two democracies were killed.
[169.08]  When the second democracy was put down,
[173.80]  the British had it in their mind that the United States
[176.08]  would do the coup, but then Iran would end up
[178.76]  in Britain's sphere of influence.
[180.88]  And the United States had a different plan,
[183.00]  which was that Iran would end up in the United States
[184.96]  as a sphere of influence.
[186.56]  And in the period from 1953 to 1979,
[190.96]  Iran and the United States became extremely close
[196.36]  to the point where the United States actually had quartered
[201.96]  its CIA operations for Asia to run.
[205.72]  And that included, because the CIA needed to be able
[208.48]  to print money quickly, that included mint plates
[211.12]  to make five and $20 bills.
[215.88]  And it included a lot of data like where the spies
[219.56]  in China were.
[221.76]  And then the United States also sold Iran at 14 top caps,
[227.76]  only two countries on planet have around 14
[230.62]  to see the United States and Iran.
[233.40]  And so we ended up with this really close relationship
[238.40]  to the point where there were jokes being made
[242.64]  that would go things like,
[243.64]  Iran is the shopping mall of the Middle East
[245.92]  or Iran is the little United States.
[251.08]  Gugu Sh, the singer, if you like pop music
[259.52]  and you wanted to hear something that was kind of culturally,
[264.88]  more or less recent in Iran, Gugu Sh is the person.
[267.68]  She's amazing, amazing artist.
[270.20]  She, her album that she put out in the 1970s
[273.04]  has her wearing a cowboy hat with bleached blonde hair
[276.32]  and she's holding two pistols.
[278.60]  And you know, like this is where they had gotten to.
[284.72]  Iran had really sort of taken on this idea
[289.24]  that it was westernizing and it was modernizing,
[292.52]  but it wasn't ready to give up its cultural pass.
[295.04]  So it was holding on to a lot of that legacy,
[298.28]  its poetry, you know, looking at the Haka Meneshi empire
[303.40]  and glorifying that and trying to put those symbol sets up.
[307.64]  And so when this comic revolution happened in 1979
[311.88]  and it all came crashing down,
[314.52]  it was the United States acted like a scoring blubber.
[318.44]  It, the United States took this extremely personally.
[322.12]  Now, obviously the Iranians also made it personal.
[325.36]  It was a, it wasn't like there are making it personal.
[331.16]  Iranian leadership was calling the United States
[332.60]  the great Satan, people were in the streets chanted mad,
[335.48]  Al-Makha, which means death to America.
[339.16]  The American flag was painted on the side of a building
[342.12]  and it ended in bombs and skulls.
[344.76]  And you know, like it was, there was a lot of really intense
[348.92]  anti-American feeling, but I think psychologically
[353.48]  the damage on the other side of the Atlantic was
[356.12]  that we felt like we had been scored.
[358.60]  Like we were rejected after this really intense relationship.
[363.80]  And it was just pendulum swing.
[366.04]  That there was a population of people who felt that Iran had just
[371.56]  gone too far and had rejected too much of its culture
[374.68]  and too much of its religion.
[376.44]  And when that happens, you're going to get a wild
[379.24]  and painful pendulum swing and that's exactly what happened.
[384.52]  The Shah during the 25 plus years between 53 and 79.
[391.32]  The Shah was a tyrant.
[393.80]  He wasn't the worst tyrant the world has ever seen by any means.
[397.80]  But he did not allow true freedom of press or true freedom of speech.
[401.16]  He didn't allow for any real political rivalry.
[404.44]  Right up until the end, Jimmy Carter put a lot of pressure on him
[408.44]  to start to liberalize.
[410.20]  But you know, it was too late.
[411.88]  It was too late to liberalize at that point.
[413.56]  He should have been doing that years earlier in transitioning,
[416.60]  especially because the clock on his life was running out.
[420.36]  And he leaves the country to go get medical treatment
[424.28]  and not until the revolution happens in his absence.
[427.56]  In many ways, it's a lot like the Soviet Union.
[429.64]  Gorbachev is doing parents' striker and glass-nost and try to
[433.48]  bring the country into a more liberal stance
[436.68]  right before it implodes.
[438.52]  And the Soviet Union dies anyway.
[442.12]  Reforms are great, but you don't want to do them too late.
[444.68]  You want to do them times to actually have them save your state.
[448.92]  So that period of time switches over to the revolution
[456.20]  period where Iran completely ends up rejecting the United States.
[460.68]  And we were in a really nasty kind of cold war status with Iran,
[469.48]  where I can become president and he encouraged Iraq to attack Iran.
[475.24]  The United States actually did militarily, not only back the Iraqis,
[478.84]  but the United States.
[480.04]  One of the multiple occasions, a bomb,
[481.88]  they're on in facilities.
[484.60]  And definitely, protest, played a very active role against Iran.
[489.80]  Ironically, and up all over North, it was selling Iran.
[492.68]  Spare parts for its U.S. equipment, including the F-14,
[496.92]  talk, shall.
[498.04]  At four times market value.
[501.08]  So we're giving Iraq all this equipment
[503.72]  and selling Iran's spare parts for its equipment.
[508.44]  And then interestingly enough, in the equipment administration,
[512.28]  there was a thought out.
[514.04]  And it was because of the Iranian president, it was almost Hato Mi.
[518.36]  Hato Mi wanted to liberalize Iran.
[521.32]  He wanted to put it into much of reforms.
[524.60]  As president, he had very limited power,
[527.08]  but because he had the backing of the people,
[528.92]  because the people really wanted this,
[531.08]  he was successfully getting some of those reforms through.
[535.08]  And he began secret negotiations with the United States
[541.00]  that became a little bit more public as time went by.
[543.96]  And the United States' number one demands was,
[547.08]  we want to start seeing U.S. products being sold in your country.
[550.84]  And the Iranians were like, okay, I mean,
[554.36]  we thought we'd be talking about other things,
[557.32]  but your first priority is to come to call.
[560.20]  And it's to be drunk of our people,
[561.88]  also, will accommodate that.
[566.60]  And then when I lived in it,
[569.16]  and when I lived and happened,
[571.48]  Iran immediately put out a condemnation
[574.68]  and then said that Iran was willing to do anything to help the United States.
[580.44]  And at that point, the United States took Iran up on that offer.
[583.72]  Iran had been backing the rebels who were fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.
[588.60]  And we basically said we wanted to have contact with those rebels,
[593.08]  because we're going to help you use them to fight the Taliban.
[596.04]  And Iran would have absolutely,
[597.56]  and I mean, if it had any of these friends,
[599.16]  we'll help you out.
[601.08]  And the Iranians thought that was it between the cooling off period,
[608.36]  or I should say the thawing off period,
[610.36]  that was taking place in the Clinton administration.
[613.24]  And then Iran helping the United States and Afghanistan,
[615.96]  I think huge portion of the Iranian government thought,
[618.76]  this is it, we're going to be friends.
[620.20]  We're going to figure this out.
[621.96]  And then in 2002, just a few months later,
[629.56]  George Bush Jr. got up and he gave you the State of the Union speech.
[633.48]  And he said there is an access available,
[635.56]  and he said it's Iraq, Iran, and North Korea.
[639.00]  And that was it.
[640.68]  The hardwriters in Iran were empowered.
[642.84]  They pushed back against the reformers.
[645.24]  And the rhetoric went back to, there's no way to make peace with the United States.
[651.32]  There's no future for that.
[653.88]  And we've been on that path really ever since.
[658.52]  There have been attempts here and there to fix things,
[662.84]  but nothing serious.
[664.52]  2015, we got the JCPOA, then Trump toward up in 2018.
[670.04]  So any attempts at bringing Iran back into the world,
[676.84]  seeing the Clinton administration and then the Obama administration were destroyed
[681.16]  by the subsequent Republican president at the K-Payment?
[684.20]  This next one is basically follow-up.
[686.20]  You covered it by answering that first one,
[689.80]  but I'll state it in its entirety and you could address it how you want.
[694.84]  But as the long history of Western intervention,
[698.44]  including regime change,
[700.44]  been driven more by political or economic motives.
[704.68]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[706.60]  So the answer is yes.
[710.76]  And the reason I'm saying that is because there are definitely times
[714.60]  when it's obviously United States is acting for political reasons,
[718.76]  and there are times when the United States is acting for economic reasons.
[722.12]  There's a pattern too, like a geographical pattern to this.
[728.44]  So for example, in Central America,
[730.60]  when the United States would go in and 100,
[733.00]  I mean, 20 years ago, in Oberthro,
[734.92]  Nicaragua's government,
[735.96]  or Oberthro-Hunderers' government,
[737.40]  or Oberthro-Bottomall's government,
[739.16]  they were very clearly interested in the price of bananas,
[742.44]  literally the price of bananas.
[744.44]  And so that's where the term banana republic comes from.
[747.96]  When we go in, overthrow the existing state
[750.60]  and then bring in a puppet who's going to lower the price of bananas.
[755.08]  So clearly that was an economic motive.
[757.24]  And a lot of what we were doing in East Asia,
[759.80]  are interventions in China and Korea, for example,
[762.84]  in the same time period, 100 and 120 years ago,
[766.52]  those were clearly very economically oriented policy just choices.
[772.28]  But then there are moments when we are clearly acting out in a way
[778.04]  that looks like it's more ideological.
[780.20]  And in the case of Iran, I think that's a clear example of it,
[784.60]  if we really cared about the economics of this,
[787.00]  we would have followed through with the integration of Iran back
[791.16]  into the global system,
[793.16]  that Hata Me was trying to pull off.
[797.16]  If Hata Me had been successful,
[799.32]  and he could have only been successful
[800.68]  if the United States gave him the economic ability,
[803.16]  right?
[803.64]  If it was used, if Iran saw there are wealth increasing,
[808.36]  it would have given him the kind of backing he needed.
[810.68]  Because you're going to remember,
[812.12]  by the Iranian Constitution,
[813.40]  the president of Iran isn't the kind in charge.
[816.12]  The supreme leader is Hens' name,
[819.08]  supreme leaders.
[821.72]  It's Daito Al-Hamanai.
[823.40]  There have only been two.
[824.92]  The other one is Homanai.
[826.60]  The current is Hamanai.
[828.92]  I swear they did that just to mess up America.
[831.72]  You constantly hear people go,
[833.40]  I didn't Hamanai.
[834.52]  No, did that guy die a long time ago.
[838.52]  It's time to update.
[842.60]  But so,
[843.56]  so there are these times when the United States
[845.96]  clearly sacrifices economics because there's something else at stake.
[849.96]  Our our blind support of Israel is another classic example of that.
[854.60]  If we really care about the economics of this,
[856.68]  we would have definitely abandoned Israel a long time ago.
[860.60]  We lose so many opportunities to do business in the Middle East because of this.
[866.04]  And then you know what we did in Vietnam was another classic example of that.
[871.64]  There are moments when we clearly are not operating on the economic,
[875.56]  by the economic motives.
[876.76]  Interesting.
[877.88]  So I think the political motives there,
[880.20]  because we see this now in US politics,
[883.08]  is that the political motives of just the public opinion to stay in power for the votes
[891.80]  far outweigh any other reason.
[894.36]  A lot of times it just leads right back to personal economic motives.
[900.20]  But yeah, I will go on the next question.
[902.44]  This is just be talking about it.
[903.88]  No, but it's important point that you bring up,
[906.04]  which is one of the problems with electoral republics is that the politicians have to
[911.32]  somehow motivate their voters to go to the voting.
[915.00]  And that's not always easy.
[918.52]  So it'd be great if you had some kind of emotional issue.
[922.36]  And you know, having a villain that you can point to and say,
[925.72]  that guy, they're bad.
[927.08]  We hate them.
[928.20]  Is a great way to motivate voters.
[931.80]  It turns out the two emotions voters are most responsive to are hatred and fear.
[938.28]  So if you can fill people with fear and hatred,
[941.00]  you can get them out there to vote.
[943.72]  By the way, the worst emotion you can get them with is disgust.
[948.28]  So that's a thin line of hatred, fear and disgust.
[951.72]  Right? You need to, if you're trying to manipulate people,
[954.76]  you've got to get it right.
[956.28]  And there are some really amazing masters at this.
[961.00]  The unfortunate thing is, is what you're literally doing is you're dividing your own
[964.68]  population and putting it off against itself in the process.
[968.04]  And eventually that will result in a civil war.
[971.88]  It's just inevitable at some point across the line.
[975.88]  Are we going to go to next topic of more US-centric US power policy and influence?
[982.20]  The question is, why has the US shifted from covert regime change to open declarations
[988.04]  of such intentions?
[989.56]  Yeah, that is a fascinating thing.
[992.20]  So, in the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union,
[1000.04]  the US reevaluated the way it was going to approach international politics.
[1004.76]  And of course, most of that was actually done under Bill Clinton.
[1008.12]  And one of the things that Bill Clinton decided to do
[1011.96]  was start defunding the State Department and increasing military funding.
[1017.32]  So he literally shifted our emphasis from diplomacy to war.
[1025.40]  This is one of Clinton's many mistakes.
[1028.04]  But he sort of ruined our approach to diplomacy by doing this.
[1036.20]  One of the things you have to remember is there was kind of a code most,
[1043.00]  most of the leaders the United States had produced in the 20th century.
[1048.60]  It's 20th century like after Roosevelt, after the second Roosevelt.
[1055.00]  So forget hearting and collage and tops, those guys.
[1060.04]  Wilson maybe you could include in this and even Thierry Roosevelt.
[1065.64]  And then everybody after Franklin.
[1070.44]  What the understanding was was that we were going to at least pretend
[1075.80]  that we were the good guys.
[1077.00]  We were going to hold ourselves to a set of standards that we would never reach.
[1085.08]  Right.
[1086.04]  But we were going to pretend that we had reached it and we were the beacon of hope for humanity.
[1091.16]  And that was that was the approach and that meant that we needed to
[1096.20]  operate in a way where the president was sort of, you know, above politics.
[1101.64]  The president looked out for the best interests of the world and the country.
[1107.40]  We were at least pretending that those things were true even when they weren't.
[1111.24]  Reagan and Nixon kind of started to break that a little bit.
[1116.60]  But even then we're holding on to it to a degree.
[1120.28]  George Borsetier is kind of the last of that that way of thinking.
[1125.00]  Let me just give you an example of what I mean.
[1128.20]  So when the Berlin Wall fell though, there was a moment there where the US could have made a really
[1136.68]  big mistake. And the difference between the big mistake and not making the big mistake was
[1144.68]  who was president.
[1146.28]  If it had been Reagan or Clinton or George Bush Jr. or Trump, I'm pretty sure we would have
[1155.72]  made the big mistake. But because it happened to be George Bush Sr., maybe Obama would have done
[1161.72]  the right thing. I'm not sure. But George Bush Sr. did it. His response to the Berlin wall coming
[1167.96]  down was to do nothing. And when you think about it, this is the perfect opportunity for Reagan or
[1176.52]  Clinton to jump on an airplane flight to Berlin, dance on the wall and thumb their noses at the
[1181.88]  Soviets and say, look, your stupid wall came down and mock them instead by Bush not doing that,
[1191.08]  but Bush not taking the opportunity to go rub it, rub salt in the wound in the Soviets.
[1196.52]  He left the door open to have a good conversation with Gorbachev and then subsequently with Boris
[1203.24]  Yeltsin. And we actually ended up because Bush's actions with 10 years of peace with the Russians.
[1212.84]  The Cold War really was lifted. And from 1990 to 2000, we really had a relationship with
[1220.76]  Russia. It was incredible to the point where George Bush Sr. went to Gorbachev and said, look,
[1230.52]  Germany is going to reunify. That's a done deal. Germany is a NATO member. That means that East
[1237.16]  Germany is going to end up being in NATO. What do I have to do to make you happy? Right? Today,
[1245.48]  a president like Trump isn't going to ask a question like that. He's going to say, too bad for you,
[1251.32]  go to hell, and that began of it. And instead, he and Gorbachev had a conversation.
[1257.56]  And they came up, by the way, with a deal. And that deal was that NATO would not expand east of
[1263.88]  of East Germany. And of course, a few years later, it started expanding east of East Germany.
[1272.20]  Was it 1999 when Poland is pulling the Hungary and the Czech Republic, I think, joined NATO in
[1281.32]  1999? I'm probably wrong about my year, but we immediately began expanding eastward,
[1288.12]  at least under the Clinton administration, even though George Bush Sr. had promised Gorbachev
[1293.16]  that would not happen. The reason I'm saying all this is because that was a style of presidency
[1300.36]  that Clinton began the process of jettisoning. Although, again, Reagan and Nixon had actually
[1306.44]  started that as even before Clinton. So that by the time we got to George Bush Jr., which was
[1313.88]  literally what George Bush Sr. Clinton, George Bush Jr., we're only talking to presidents
[1319.00]  later. He's openly actively talking about overthrowing governments in the Middle East,
[1323.88]  one after the other, right, taking out the Taliban, taking out Saddam Hussein. One thing
[1330.52]  when they were talking about taking out Saddam Hussein, they actually came up with a list of
[1334.68]  countries they were going to invade in conquer. And there were two different lists that were being
[1339.64]  circulated. One list was that it would go, the first thing to do was Iraq, then Syria, then Lebanon.
[1349.16]  And then I think they wanted to do, I think this is the order, after Lebanon, Libya, then Sudan,
[1355.72]  and then they would end with Iran. And they were going to change everybody's flags,
[1360.92]  and they were going to send Christian missionaries to these countries to try and Christianize them.
[1365.16]  And they were going to send in the IMF and the World Bank, and they were going to completely
[1369.48]  redo these countries. They would all have white and light blue stripes on their flags. And
[1376.52]  they were going to be redone in the United States' image. That was the goal. The other plan was
[1381.40]  they would invade Iraq, and then they would either do Iran or Syria next. And then after that,
[1386.28]  they were going to go for Saudi Arabia, and then finally they're going to end with Egypt.
[1390.12]  And both of these plans were based on the idea that there was nothing that the Middle East could
[1395.32]  do to stop this from happening. And of course, what ended up happening was Iraq and Afghanistan just
[1401.88]  humiliated the United States and stopped them cold and in our tracks.
[1407.08]  And here we are in the Middle East. It's in much more shape than it was when we found it.
[1415.64]  So, beginning with George Bush Jr., there was just no even pretending that we were about
[1424.36]  letting people have the right to self-determination. There was no, we get that at all been
[1429.16]  jettisoned. And instead of us relying on state department to go in there with soft power and
[1434.60]  try and convince people, the whole idea was we were going to go in there with military power and
[1439.56]  overwhelm. But the real origins of this, of course, was the CIA running around overthrowing
[1446.60]  democracies. And literally waging terrorist campaigns to try and convince voters to go one
[1453.24]  way or the other. And so, yeah, it was a long time in the making, basically. But you should do a
[1463.00]  talk just on the unchecked operations of the CIA for a while. Yeah, I mean,
[1471.08]  if I were the king of the United States, I would just delete the CIA. I don't see what purpose
[1476.28]  deserve. Okay, they were kind of their own sovereign entity for a long time. They really were.
[1480.92]  And they taxed. Tax-payer dollars. It was created by a group of men that went to the government
[1486.28]  and said, do you want us or will fund us? Oh, we just go do it on her own. And the government went,
[1492.68]  okay, we'll fund you. Like, this is not okay. That's what we decided. We decided we wanted to have a
[1498.36]  wing of chaos creation that would assassinate people and overthrow democracies. But you know what's
[1504.20]  crazy is they suck at predicting anything. They didn't, they didn't predict the fall of the Soviet
[1509.72]  Union. They didn't predict the breakup of Yugoslavia. They didn't predict the fall of Koshchara
[1514.12]  Essence government. Like they, they have never actually served us any other purpose than being
[1521.32]  a chaos-sowing entity other than corporate espionage. They do, they do success point
[1528.20]  spiral of their people's companies and still their secrets. This is an interesting question.
[1532.20]  It kind of gets into the hypocrisy of our American ideology or US's ideological background
[1539.80]  for some of our actions. The question is, how do American leaders and media reconcile promoting
[1547.56]  human rights while backing governments that violate international law? Yeah, this is one of those
[1555.24]  interesting things. Okay, so it's not hard to come up with the list of the governments that violate
[1560.52]  international law war crimes, crimes against humanity with the United States box.
[1566.36]  What you have to also remember, the United States is actually never been the beacon of goodness
[1571.80]  that it pretends to be. I mean, it wasn't that longer going than the United States was,
[1577.56]  still had slavery and it wasn't that longer going than the United States was, oh, well,
[1581.56]  the United States is still actively committing genocide against Native Americans.
[1586.04]  So we have our own human rights violations that we regularly do with the Native American population.
[1594.28]  You know, with unarmed black people in the way that police deal with them. What we're doing now
[1600.20]  is not immigrants. We are clearly in that zone where we're the human rights violator. So at some
[1607.16]  level, us interacting with human rights violators isn't really hypocrisy. The hypocrisy is the way
[1612.92]  we're portrayed. The way we're portrayed in movies, the way we're portrayed in the news,
[1618.28]  as you know, we're the good guy who are all we stand for human rights. Ironically, in many ways,
[1625.32]  countries that we've villainized frequently actually did a better job of standing for human rights.
[1633.16]  Yeah, I think the average American in their mind thinks we, yeah, what we're doing is wrong, but
[1642.36]  it's what we need to do for the greater good. Like if I commit enough evil,
[1648.36]  there will be goodness created in the world. And I think that's how they reconcile in their heads.
[1654.68]  The ends justify the means. The ends justify the means. And obviously I disagree with that.
[1661.48]  They never ends. That's just an endless justification cycle of doing horrible things.
[1665.96]  Yeah, and one of the things we do too is we oversimplify things. You know, like, for example,
[1670.20]  I think in our minds that monarchy is bad and democracy is good, but you know, there are plenty of
[1677.32]  monarchy in the world that are working great and they produce fantastic outcomes. And there are
[1683.80]  republics in the world that aren't working great. They're not producing fantastic outcomes. And I
[1688.12]  think that's also a problem that we've made this too ideological. You know, like if you're capitalist
[1692.76]  in your democracy, you're automatically good. And that isn't necessarily the case.
[1700.36]  Yeah, so I think there's like an oversimplification on the part of the public. And there's also this
[1708.04]  deal with the demo attitude. Here it's going on to another question, which is kind of an interesting
[1712.92]  dichotomy. It's a really good question, I think. Why is Israel allowed to possess nuclear weapons
[1719.64]  while Iran faces intense opposition or even pursuing enrichment? Yeah, so one of the
[1727.32]  interesting things is if you look back at when Israel really started thinking about getting
[1731.96]  nuclear weapons, the United States was against it and resisted Israel getting the nuclear weapon.
[1738.44]  Israel's response to that was to break into the Oak Ridge Tennessee plant and that literally
[1744.52]  steel material out of it and bring it to to Israel. And then of course, Israel began working with
[1753.08]  apartheid South Africa. And apartheid South Africa had access to plenty of uranium. Israel had
[1759.96]  the know-how. They didn't have the material. And they said to the South Africans, look,
[1764.76]  we'll help you build new because if you give us the material. And they struck a deal.
[1771.48]  I think it was 1979. I could be wrong with my year. It was during the Carter administration,
[1779.00]  but somebody mysteriously detonated a nuclear bomb in the South Atlantic. And then I want to say
[1786.04]  the next year there was another two or three detonations. And you know, Jimmy Carter's response
[1791.40]  was to do nothing. But it was very clear to everybody on the planet that it was in apartheid South
[1798.36]  Africa. His real tests, these were tests. They were just making sure that the notes that were
[1805.00]  being made worked. And it's very probable that these really had the nukes, you know, maybe as much
[1810.76]  as 10 years prior, but they just didn't have, they hadn't tested them yet. So, 79 I think is the test
[1818.36]  year. And in a way that was all on purpose, the Israelis wanted the world to know they had the
[1825.88]  nukes, but didn't want to detonate them in their own territory because they didn't want anybody
[1832.20]  able to prove that they had them. And in that way, it could be a threat that they could use
[1837.80]  against potential rivals. Like, look, we have the nukes. We will use it. You need to back off.
[1843.88]  At the end of the day, the answer is the United States Security Council vote. The United States,
[1852.60]  the Security Council has, I don't know how many votes at this point, pointing out every time
[1857.24]  Israel has done a crime against humanity. And the United States steps in and says no and vetoes it.
[1863.64]  The United States allows Israel to literally break every, every law ever created, including
[1871.24]  by us, you know, international conduct. For example, it is. It was one of the defenses during the
[1881.08]  war during the nerve-wracked trials that the Nazis were using, that they get a preemptive war
[1886.12]  against First Poland and later the Soviet Union because they believed that Poland and the Soviet Union
[1892.12]  posed a direct threat to Germany and Germany's security and they were just trying to eliminate that
[1898.04]  threat. And we were like guilty and we put a news around their neck and broke their neck and
[1905.72]  killed them and declared that a preemptive war was a crime against humanity or a war crime. Sorry,
[1914.12]  it's a war crime. Well, what do you call what Israel does on a daily basis when they're attacking
[1921.32]  Gaza, when they're attacking Syria, when they're attacking Lebanon, and now they're attacking Iran?
[1925.64]  Those are all preemptive strikes that the United States itself said was a war crime and yet here
[1933.96]  we are. And the world really doesn't seem to be interested in doing anything about it. One of the
[1940.44]  things that comes up from time to time is why aren't the Arabs doing something about it? Well,
[1945.72]  there was a war in 48. There was a war in 56. There was a war in 67. There was a war in 73. Then
[1952.28]  the Israelis invaded 11 on 78 and withdrew and then they invaded in 82 and stayed until 2000.
[1958.44]  And the answer is that the Palestinians are herbs and they are stuck in a perpetual war now
[1964.68]  since 1948. And the problem isn't that the Arabs aren't fighting the Israelis. The problem is that
[1970.92]  there's no way to win as long as the United States backs Israel. And that was proven in 1973.
[1977.56]  In the first two days of the 1973 war, Egypt beat the crap out of the Israeli military and the
[1982.60]  United States intervened and saved Israel and put Israel into a position where it could do a
[1987.40]  counteroffensive and militarily win the 73 war. It was like cheating at that point. And
[1993.88]  President Sadat got up in front of the world and said, we prove we can beat Israel. But nobody can
[1999.32]  beat the United States. And I think that was the moment when the Arab world just went,
[2007.16]  okay, we're going to have to endure this. There is no way out of this. The United States is
[2013.40]  going to let Israel just do whatever it wants to. And how do you disarm a nuclear power anyway?
[2021.40]  Do you invade it? Let's drop nukes. That's all I hear. I mean, that's the lesson North Korea has
[2028.52]  taught the world if you have the nuke, you'll be left alone. So is that the reason you think that
[2034.28]  Iran pursuing nuclear enrichment has been so opposed by everyone because Israel,
[2039.48]  it sounds like they just kind of snuck it in and did it and are like, no, now you need to
[2044.12]  have them. We're not going to mess with it. But since Iran doesn't have it yet,
[2050.04]  we want you to not have it. Yeah, I mean, that's 100%. We don't want Iran to get the
[2055.96]  nukes because at that point we can't invade it. There's no military option going forward.
[2061.48]  Israel won't be able to terrorize it in the moment. Having said that, all intelligence
[2069.32]  reports that I've seen anyway, including those issued by Tulsi Gabbard, a member of the Trump
[2073.72]  administration, have said that basically since 2015, Iran has been playing by the rule of the
[2080.12]  JCPOA, even though Trump tore it up in 2018. And so in reality, Iran is not actively pursuing
[2087.56]  the creation of the nukes, at least according to the intelligence reports that are out there. So
[2094.60]  you know, I know every every year that Niyahu says Iran is within two months of making a nuk.
[2102.36]  And he's been saying that what since 2012, I believe. So we're now 13 years from Iran being within
[2110.84]  two months of making the nuk. If they have the nuk, I don't think Israel would have attacked.
[2117.64]  I don't think that was on the table. And I think right now the Iranian government is going, okay,
[2124.12]  less of our, and we were playing, you know, by the rules for 10 years, even though the
[2129.56]  treaty that we had signed, you'll literally torn up, I bet you they're going to do everything
[2135.00]  they can to get the nukes passes they can, including maybe cheating and buying it, like just
[2139.16]  buying one from North Korea or something. What why wouldn't think? Oh, I would, I would do
[2143.48]  everything I could to get it now. Bless him learn is what I would see this as. And for that matter,
[2149.48]  your Saudi Arabia, if you're Turkey, if you're Germany, your Japan, South Korea, Indonesia,
[2155.32]  like I think everybody should be scrambling to get a whole of a nuk at this point. Oh, yeah.
[2161.80]  Maybe there's no law, right? There's no, there's no international law.
[2167.40]  And it's just a bunch of broke countries, including the United States. Like, what are the United States
[2171.24]  that do you rock and that kind of stuff? Like, what was that? Yeah, it was something, you know, as soon as
[2175.32]  you, as soon as you have the capability, then you have more say. Yeah, I know. You have more control
[2182.44]  because people aren't going to, it's not worth the risk. It's not worth the risk. I mean,
[2189.08]  look at how many times you can be in Pakistan, I've been on the brink of breaking out of your war.
[2192.60]  I think every time they're like, oh, oh, wait, we can't fight each other anymore. All right,
[2198.60]  why let's stop. All right, so let's, let's dig back into the current situation. These are more
[2206.04]  theoretical looking into the future of what's currently going on. So the topic is escalation risks
[2210.68]  and tactical scenarios. First question is, what is the worst case scenario for the US in this conflict?
[2217.56]  Okay, I've been thinking about this. So the worst case scenario is that Iran feels like it's
[2223.32]  back into a corner and there's no way out. And what all happened at that point, I believe, I
[2231.64]  could be wrong, but I think that's what the attack and daughter was a signal for.
[2236.92]  Why are we going to attack a military base? Probably not going to kill anybody. We're probably not
[2242.04]  going to do any major damage. We're going to do this and we're going to do this in Guapa. Like Guapa is
[2251.08]  at worst, it's a neutral state. At best, it's actually leaning pro-Iran. Like it has a friendly
[2257.48]  relationship with Iran. And Guatar has served the United States as a negotiator. Guatar is our
[2264.92]  primary negotiator when he comes off and the Taliban, for example. So for Iran to attack Guatar was
[2271.56]  really fascinating. Like it's sending a signal. And here's the signal I heard. I could be wrong,
[2278.44]  but this is what I heard. If you guys keep escalating and you back us into a corner, we're not going
[2283.24]  to shut down, we're not going to just shut down the spades of all moves. We're going to start
[2287.24]  sinking oil tankers. We're going to start targeting not just military bases, but we're going to
[2291.64]  target oil facilities and we're not going to care what country those oil facilities are in.
[2297.16]  And we're going to have our hooties shut down, Babel Mendeb, and keep launching missiles
[2301.64]  at all the ships in the Red Sea. And we're going to go for breaking the global economy. That's the
[2306.76]  message I heard. And at that point then, what's the United States's response going to be? We will
[2313.40]  look like idiots and fools if we don't strike back. And as a result, what are we going to keep
[2321.80]  launching missiles up there? They're going to keep launching missiles at us. At some point,
[2325.00]  we'll have to put boots on the ground. Iran is 90 plus million people. Afghanistan today is 40
[2331.64]  million. When we invaded, it wasn't. I think it was 30 million. So we couldn't defeat a country
[2340.04]  one-third the size of Iran. And we were there 20 years and we were so shamed and humiliated,
[2347.64]  the government we did put it in, fell before we even withdrew. So we have no chance against
[2353.88]  Iran if we put boots on the ground. They know it. And that's the big dangers that we'll get
[2361.08]  sucked into another world of the United States can't win. And we have tramped at the helm. You could
[2367.00]  totally see how it can happen. It could go worse than that. And the worst scenario would be that
[2373.00]  Russia and China got involved directly. I don't think that's on the table because I think Russia
[2378.52]  and China would rather watch the United States get stuck in another war. They can't win and watch
[2383.24]  from the sidelines as they pump weapons and money into Iran. But World War Three is definitely on
[2390.92]  the table. That's the next question. Is this conflict laying the groundwork for a third world war?
[2399.24]  It is possible. I think it's unlikely. And the reason I think it's unlikely is because I think
[2404.36]  the Russians and the Chinese don't watch. There's nothing in it for them. Having said that, I could see a
[2410.68]  mistake happening. And here's the scenario where the mistake happens. The United States does get
[2417.80]  too heavily involved in a war with Iran. And China goes, now's our chance to grab Taiwan. And China
[2425.08]  goes to grab Taiwan. And Trump throws down and says, no, and the next thing you know we're in
[2431.16]  shooting war with the Chinese and Taiwan. So I think that's the flash point is that there will be a
[2437.72]  miscalculation on the part of China over Taiwan because they'll think that Trump has either
[2445.72]  signaled by accident that he doesn't care about Taiwan because he keeps doing that. He keeps saying,
[2450.68]  I don't care about our allies. I'm not interested in defending them. And then they'll make this mistake.
[2458.44]  Or they'll offer Taiwan and Trump will be like, I don't care. It'll let it happen. And Taiwan goes,
[2466.36]  and that's it because I think they can't defend themselves without us. So at that point, of course,
[2472.36]  if you're South Korea and you're Japan and for that matter, Vietnam and the Philippines and Indonesia,
[2477.80]  you're in Palek mode because you're thinking, oh my god, who's next? I think that's the big fear in
[2484.20]  Europe as well, right? Who's next in Putin's line? Now, fortunately for Europe, Ukraine has held
[2491.08]  its ground and Putin hasn't been able to win the war. And as far as Europe's concern,
[2497.24]  as long as Putin is stuck fighting Ukraine, he's not fighting in Poland, right? He's not expanding the
[2502.76]  war. So this isn't actually a defeat for Europe at this point. It's not great, but these are the
[2510.92]  types of situations though that can easily end up in an accident and they spiral out of control.
[2516.68]  So this next question you touched on when you were talking about Iran being back into a corner
[2522.76]  and disrupting the global economy. So the question is, can you explain how a global war might
[2527.96]  affect food supply chains in everyday civilian life? All right. Yeah, that's a huge question.
[2538.04]  Look what the Houthis managed to do just by watching a few missiles last year into the Red Sea,
[2544.52]  right? All that shipping that was going to the Suez Canal got turned around and sent around Africa.
[2550.92]  And it caused serious delays, especially in Europe, shortages in stores. And then even a few years
[2559.08]  earlier, that ship that went sideways and the Suez Canal unblocked it and it caused massive
[2565.88]  their supply chains. Just a simple ship accident can have this kind of an impact. So the answer is,
[2573.32]  if we do a large scale global war, it will have a catastrophic effect on trade and shipping
[2579.96]  in a time where our planet is completely in your twine. So the grapes that you're eating in winter
[2587.24]  are probably grown in Chile and you're probably eating shrimp that was grown in Brunei and you're
[2592.60]  eating salmon that was raised in Norway. And all of a sudden those those trade lines get disrupted,
[2601.16]  like how do we compensate for that? Obviously we can give up the grapes from Chile, but the protein
[2607.64]  that we're getting from Norway and Brunei might be harder to replace. And we're going to we're going
[2613.40]  to be in a world of hurt. If we ended up in World War III, I think I think everybody would stop
[2620.52]  before it got to nuclear, just for the record. I don't think it has to end in a nuclear war. In fact,
[2624.60]  I think 99% it won't. What will happen is the blue side that's losing will threaten in a nuclear
[2630.28]  war and then everybody will go to negotiating tables. What what I think will happen though is
[2637.08]  if the war is fought for two years, it probably will probably see a hundred million people die a year
[2642.84]  from starvation. Because the destruction to the global economic system will not just
[2650.04]  take food off the table. It will take money out of people's wallets. And I don't know if people will
[2654.44]  feed themselves. And so the war will be a mass starvation event more than a convoc triggered
[2660.28]  loss event. And that's the scary thing about World War II. The joke I'm trying to tell them
[2667.96]  make it funny is if World War III happens, there will be two types of people, people who know the
[2673.40]  taste of human flesh and dinner. I didn't expect that second one. We have one more question and it's
[2680.12]  about a reaction from the Iranian people. What is the likelihood that Iranians will rise up against
[2686.92]  their government in this moment or instead rally around their flag? So we've seen Iranians basically
[2696.44]  rise up multiple times. The Aminie uprising that took place just a couple of years ago,
[2705.32]  three years ago, and then the 2009 Green Movement, Massal Aminie, I forgot her first name, the Massal
[2712.44]  Aminie uprising and then the 2009 Green Movement. But even before that, was it how to be elected in 98?
[2721.16]  I think it was 97, 98. You know, Iranians have been trying to either reform or topple their government
[2731.24]  and they've had really courageous attempts at this. My experience looking at history is that when
[2742.04]  you start bombing a country, those types of reforms go by by really fast. I mean the classic example,
[2748.92]  this was Germany World War II. So up until 1943, one third, one out of every three Germans was
[2757.16]  actively resisting the Nazis. They were doing things like keeping their children from joining the
[2763.00]  Hitler youth. They were sabotaging equipment. One of the interesting things is with all the
[2770.20]  German quality stuff that we think about and talk about, they were having trouble with their
[2776.28]  ammunition being unreliable because the fuses were often shorted and so their shells wouldn't go off
[2783.00]  because Germans were literally sabotaging them. But by about 1943, the US bombing campaign
[2791.80]  had flipped that around and Germans began to think, oh my god, we're all going to die if we don't win.
[2798.52]  And they began to rally around the state even though they disagreed with it because they began
[2804.76]  to see it as, oh my god, we have to survive. How do we survive this? They're blowing our cities up.
[2810.84]  And I think that's what, obviously there's a ceasefire right now, but it's already been violated,
[2817.88]  but maybe it'll hold. Who knows. If the ceasefire holds, maybe 12 days of exchanging fire back and
[2825.72]  fourth won't have an effect. I think if the ceasefire falls apart and they return to shooting
[2831.56]  at each other, I think we'll start to see Iranian people rally around the flag and reform goes out
[2837.48]  the window. The only possible way that doesn't happen is if the Iranian economy collapses and people
[2846.28]  are literally starving to death, then maybe you'll see a revolution. But what will probably happen
[2852.60]  is Humaneil jump on an airplane and fly to Moscow, Beijing and hang out with Fashal Alassif and you know
[2862.44]  I don't think he's going to get dragged through the streets. So you know, and then at that point what
[2869.40]  is the IRGC going to do? Who knows? But bombing a country has not historically helped reform movements
[2880.04]  or revelations. Yeah. So there's a bunch of Iranians right now. Iranians in the diaspora,
[2889.56]  Iranians in Iran thinking this is the end of the Islamic Republic and I think they're going to be
[2894.44]  really sad. I don't see it. Yeah, we'll see. There's been a lot of surprises. Yeah, and that's the
[2902.36]  thing. History has gotten a little bit unpredictable and it's entirely possible this well. Break it
[2909.80]  down to the Islamic Republic and we'll sink up by our own and have a great time. I mean, look at
[2915.24]  Abdulla Bachel Alassif and your team. It went down so quickly and nobody saw it coming. Nobody predicted it.
[2920.76]  So even even the guys who did it were thinking they were nine months away and it turned out they were
[2926.36]  nine days away and they're like, wait, what happened? Well, thank you Roy for hanging out and thank
[2936.04]  you for answering questions from your community and a lot of people are going to be really grateful.
[2942.52]  Oh, thanks for there. This will make you happy.
